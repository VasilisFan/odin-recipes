        <h2>Execution Method</h2>
        <h3>For the eggplants </h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F) set to fan.</li>
            <li>Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Cut the eggplants lengthwise in half, keeping the stem intact.</li>
            <li>Score the inside of the eggplants in a crisscross pattern with a knife, being careful not to cut through the skin. </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper, and spread them with your hands to marinate the inner side well. </li>
            <li>Place the eggplants on the baking pan, skin-side up, put the pan in the oven, and bake the eggplants for 40 minutes until tender. (At this point, you can prepare the meat sauce and béchamel.) </li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the oven and, if the meat sauce and béchamel are ready, increase the oven’s temperature to 220°C (430°F) set to broiler. </li>
            <li>Turn the eggplants skin-side down, gently press the flesh with a spoon to create space for the meat filling, and set them aside.</li>
        </ol> 
        <h3>For the meat sauce </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the onion, garlic, and parsley, cut the zucchini into small cubes, and set them aside. </li>
            <li>Place a non-stick frying pan over high heat, add the olive oil, and let it heat up well.  </li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sauté it for 3-4 minutes until nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, zucchini, and garlic, mix with a wooden spoon, and keep sauteing for 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with the wine and let its alcohol evaporate completely. </li>
            <li>Add the canned tomatoes, sugar, cinnamon stick, thyme, salt, and pepper, mix well, and cook the sauce for another 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat, add the parsley and gruyere cheese, and mix with a serving spoon.  </li>
            <li>Fill the eggplants with the meat sauce and set them aside.</li>
        </ol>  
        <h3>For the bechamel sauce</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Place a small pot over medium heat, add the butter cut into cubes, and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and mix with a wooden spoon well for 1-2 minutes until they are completely combined and you have a smooth paste.  </li>
            <li>Add the milk in 3-4 batches, whisking constantly until the mixture comes to a boil, thickens, and the first bubbles appear on the surface.  </li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat, add the 50 g gruyere cheese, nutmeg, egg yolks, salt, and pepper, and whisk well until completely combined. </li>
            <li>Spoon about 3 tablespoons of bechamel sauce over each eggplant, and spread it carefully over the meat sauce. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining gruyere cheese over the bechamel sauce, put the pan in the oven, and bake for 10-15 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the oven.  </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the decoration</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potato and cut it -from its large side- into very thin slices using a mandoline slicer.</li>
            <li>Stack the slices on top of each other and cut them into very thin sticks. </li>
            <li>Separate the sticks with your hands and transfer them to a bowl of water. </li>
            <li>Rinse very well to remove the starch, drain them well, and pat dry with paper towels. </li>
            <li>Place a deep frying pan over high heat, add the sunflower oil, and let it heat up well.  </li>
            <li>Line a small baking pan with paper towels and set it aside.  </li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium, add the potato sticks to the pan in 2 batches, and fry them for 3 minutes until crispy.  </li>
            <li>Transfer them to the baking pan using a slotted spoon, and remove the pan from the heat.  </li>
            <li>Divide the potato chips over the eggplants.  </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chips with salt and serve with finely chopped parsley.  </li>
        </ol>
